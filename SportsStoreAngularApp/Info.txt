		in. I add other modules in later chapters to support specific features, such as working with
		HTML forms.

		This is the Reactive Extensions package, which is used to implement the
		Angular change-detection system that is used in data bindings, and used directly for some Angular features.

		This is the Zone.js package, which provides an execution context for
		asynchronous tasks and is used to evaluate template expressions.
	core-js
